##  Project Overview

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate hospital performance through financial, trend, and provider-based analyses. The financial analysis covered detailed transaction categories such as treatment costs, medical expenses, insurance claims, room charges, and overall billing amounts. These metrics were examined across various dimensions, including geography, procedure types, departments, and diagnoses using dynamic visuals. The trend analysis highlighted billing performance over time—comparing previous months, weekly patterns, and year-over-year insights by department and service type. The provider analysis featured filters for individual doctors, displaying KPIs like total visits, outpatient vs. admitted counts, length of stay, and state-wise distribution, with visuals adapting interactively to selected inputs. This end-to-end solution enabled stakeholders to identify cost drivers, optimize operational efficiency, and support strategic decisions in hospital management.

## Key Features

This project leverages advanced DAX functions to drive critical healthcare KPIs such as total billing amount, medical costs, treatment expenses, insurance coverage, out-of-pocket charges, and room fees. Custom measures were created to enable time-based comparisons (e.g., previous month, quarter, or week) and to distinguish between emergency vs. non-emergency cases. Additional DAX logic enabled conditional formatting for enhanced readability (e.g., color changes based on thresholds), parameterized measures, and averages per diagnosis, department, or doctor for better benchmarking and decision-making.The dashboard features a rich set of interactive Power BI visualizations, including maps, 100% stacked charts, bar/column charts, zebra charts, doughnut and area charts, and dynamic slicers. These visuals allow users to explore data across multiple dimensions—state, city, diagnosis, department, procedure type, service category (emergency/non-emergency), and provider performance. Custom slicers and filters support role-based exploration, allowing stakeholders to uncover hidden patterns, monitor real-time trends, and make informed, data-driven decisions.

## Highlights

- **Cover Dashboard:** Page Navigation to each Dashboard.

- **Financial Analysis:** This module focuses on the financial analysis of key cost components within the hospital system. It includes precise calculations for major categories such as treatment costs, medical expenses, insurance claims, room charges, and total billing amounts. The dashboard utilizes these metrics to generate insightful visualizations, enabling stakeholders to evaluate financial performance across multiple dimensions. Users can analyze total billing and its contributing factors by city or state, procedure type, department, diagnosis category, and service type (emergency vs. non-emergency). These dynamic visual breakdowns help uncover cost drivers, optimize resource allocation, and improve financial decision-making within the healthcare environment.



- **Trends Analysis:** This section provides a detailed view of total billing trends over various timeframes to support performance tracking and operational forecasting. Key comparisons include total billing vs. previous month, weekday-based billing analysis by department, and aggregated billing performance by year, quarter, and week type. The dashboard features customized charts and Zebra charts to highlight department-specific trends, enabling stakeholders to detect seasonal patterns, monitor fluctuations, and assess departmental growth or decline over time. These time-based insights help in identifying underperforming areas and planning resource distribution more effectively.



- **Provider Analysis:** This module focuses on evaluating the performance of individual doctors and their impact on hospital operations. It includes interactive filters to select specific providers, dynamically updating key metrics such as total visits, outpatient count, admitted patients, length of stay, and state-wise patient distribution. Visualizations adapt in real-time based on the selected doctor, offering a clear view of provider-specific workload and efficiency. This helps stakeholders assess doctor performance, patient flow patterns, and optimize staff allocation across departments for improved healthcare delivery.


- **Dark Mode:** Designed a Dark Mode version of each dashboard to enhance visual comfort, accessibility, and user experience, especially for extended usage or low-light environments.

- **Filters and page nagivation:** Filters based on teh Ethnicity and Calender. Page navigation in the Each page.


- **ER-Diagram:** The Entity Relationship Diagram visually represents the data structure and relationships within the healthcare analytics project. Gain a deeper understanding of the underlying data architecture.
